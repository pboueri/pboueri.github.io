Personal website:
- Index -- a summary section that links to the following subsections. It has a headshot from assets/ as well as a summary about what this site yet. 
- Prompts -- the prompts that are used to generate the site sourced from prompts/
- Project -- a set of interactive web demos. start with two demos, just links and a basic webpage to start: 
    - 1. Hysterai
    - 2. The Baibel Tells Me So
- Blog -- a set of writings that come from blog

Set up the github actions file, the basic structure re-using what exists, and create the scaffolding.
