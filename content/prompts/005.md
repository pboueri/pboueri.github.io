# Prompt Diff Viewer

**GENERATED: 2025-01-06T18:45:00Z**

For every prompt that's generated on the site, the user should be able to flip through all the difs as someone goes through it. The diffs should be generated from git at Hugo build time, automatically extracting the git history for each prompt file. 

When viewing a prompt at blog/prompts, there should be arrows that go left and right, which can also be key-binded to the left and right arrows. The diffs from Git should be rendered with the additions and removals mined from the Git history. These diffs should then be viewable by the user as they flip through, starting with the most recent version of the prompt and then allowing you to go backwards in history with the left arrow.

The Hugo build process should:
1. Automatically generate git diff data for all prompts in the prompts/ folder
2. Make this data available to the prompt pages without manual intervention
3. Work for all existing and future prompts without requiring manual updates
