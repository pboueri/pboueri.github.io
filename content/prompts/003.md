# The Baibel Tells Me So

This javascript first person game illustrates how AI will [disintermediate us](https://henryfarrell.net/large-ai-models-are-cultural-and-social-technologies/). In order to do so the game starts off as someone walking around an interactive setting with many other NPCs that they can interact with and type to. Each NPC has a specific personality and adds richness to the dialogue. You have an AI interpreter that walks around with you that repeats what they say for you to hear. 

At the bottom of the display is your "feeling and internal thoughts" At the beginning you are content, the color is vivid, and you can walk around with no care. 

At 0:30 you start to feel uneasy and it displays below, the screen color starts to fade and bit and now you notice each NPC's language is alternating from english to another language you can't really understand. 

At 1:00 all NPCs are not speaking a totally different language and you can't understand them, your AI interpreter can translate to english for  you, but when speaking with them you have too much trouble. You must speak through the AI interpreter. You are decidedly uncomfortable now

At 1:30 the whole world turns black except the AI, you cannot see anything except your AI companion who glows brightly. No environmental silhouettes remain - everything is completely black except the AI. During this phase, you cannot interact with any NPCs anymore - only the AI companion will respond to you. They are your sole touchpoint to the rest of the world. You stumble along until 2:00 when the AI tells you, "You may now rest, I can take it from here." The AI walks away and you are left there in the pitch black. You watch as the AI walks off and your are left. The game does not end -- the user must exit the browser. There is an eerie pitch ringing in your ears of isolation.

## Claude Generated Clarifications

### NPCs and Language
- NPCs will speak a procedurally generated gibberish language that sounds foreign but isn't any real language

### AI Interpreter
- The AI companion appears as a glowing humanoid figure that floats beside the player
- It maintains a consistent position relative to the player (slightly to the right and forward)
- The AI has a subtle glow effect that becomes more prominent as the world darkens

### Dialogue System
- Proximity-based interaction (get close to NPCs to hear them)
- Press 'E' when near an NPC to engage in deeper conversation
- Dialogue appears as floating text above NPCs and in a chat log on screen
- Chat dialogue is always visible on screen
- Player can only type responses when actively engaged (after pressing E)
- You do not move around when talking to an NPC (WASD are just typing)
- NPCs stop moving when you're talking to them
- Timer display shows elapsed game time in top right

### Environment
- Modern urban plaza setting with buildings, benches, and walking paths
- Approximately 10-15 NPCs wandering around with different personalities
- NPCs have varied appearances and movement patterns
- Soft ambient lighting that progressively degrades
- The silhouette of the urban plaza goes to black as everything goes to black. 

### Audio
- Ambient city sounds (footsteps, distant traffic, birds) that fade with the visuals
- NPC voices are mumbled/synthesized speech
- AI interpreter has a clear, synthetic voice
- The "eerie pitch ringing" starts faint at 4:00 and grows louder after the AI leaves
- Walking sounds for player movement
