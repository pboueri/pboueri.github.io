Race against time and an ever-evolving AI amoeba in this modern take on the myth of Sisyphus. As you struggle to reach the summit, the amoeba learns, adapts, and changes the very rules of the game itself - illustrating the relentless advance of AI that will inevitably catch up to us all.

## About

Hysterai captures the inevitability of AI through gameplay mechanics where the antagonist - an organic, blob-like amoeba - doesn't just chase you, it actively rewrites the rules. Using OpenAI's API, the amoeba makes intelligent decisions to hinder your progress: inverting controls, distorting your vision, slowing your movement, or growing stronger.

The game asks: can you reach the summit before AI catches up? And even if you do, can you ever truly escape?

## Features

## Themes Explored

The game serves as a metaphor for humanity's relationship with AI - we run toward our goals while AI advances behind us, not just following but actively changing the landscape. The title itself shifts between "Hysteria" and "Hysterai," representing our oscillation between panic about AI and acceptance of its inevitability.
