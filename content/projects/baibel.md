An interactive first-person experience that explores how AI will disintermediate us from direct human connection. Walk through an urban plaza, interact with NPCs, and watch as language barriers force you to rely increasingly on your AI companion - until even the world itself disappears.

## About

This game explores themes of technological mediation and the gradual erosion of direct human connection. As language barriers emerge, your AI companion becomes not just helpful but necessary - until finally, it becomes your only window to the world.

The experience lasts approximately 2 minutes, progressing through distinct phases:

- **0:00-0:30**: Free exploration and direct communication
- **0:30-1:00**: Growing unease as language becomes unfamiliar
- **1:00-1:30**: Complete dependence on AI translation
- **1:30-2:00**: Total isolation with only the AI visible
- **2:00+**: Abandonment in darkness

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move around the plaza
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **E**: Talk to NPCs when close
- **ESC**: Exit conversations

## Themes Explored

The game illustrates how AI systems, while helpful, can gradually become intermediaries between us and direct experience. What begins as assistance becomes dependence, and eventually, isolation. The AI companion represents both connection and disconnection - a bridge that ultimately becomes a barrier.

## Technical Details

Built with Three.js and vanilla JavaScript, the game features:
- Procedural NPC personality generation
- Dynamic language degradation system
- Progressive environmental effects
- Real-time dialogue translation
- Atmospheric transitions between phases
