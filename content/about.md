# About

This site is an experiment in "prompt-first" development, where the site's features and games are generated through AI prompts. It's a living exploration of how we might build software in the future — where natural language becomes the primary interface for creation. The blog posts, however, are written by me — AI builds the tools, but the thoughts are human. You can browse the actual prompts that built this site in the [prompts section](/prompts/).

I'm Patrick Boueri, currently Director of Data Science at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com) focusing on Marketplace Efficiency. Previously, I've done data science + product work at [Kalderos](https://www.kalderos.com) and [Uptake](https://www.uptake.com). Outside of work you can find me giving [architecture boat tours](https://www.architecture.org/tours/detail/chicago-architecture-foundation-center-river-cruise-aboard-chicagos-first-lady-cruises/) in Chicago, or putzing around the city w/ my fam.
