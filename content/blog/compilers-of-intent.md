# Compilers of Intent

Maybe the most disconcerting thing about the recent Coding Agents has been their ability to take imprecise instruction and render precise, working code. Programming language grammers are formal things, they have a clear syntax, clear rules, that can be parsed and manipulated into trees, then compiled and rewritten progressively lowered to machine instructions. Yes it's complicated. Yes, no single person can understand it. But the _grammar_ was all well defined... no more. This, I believe, represents a total departure from how we have built up abstractions in the past.
