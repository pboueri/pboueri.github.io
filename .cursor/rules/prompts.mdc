# Prompts

- All site prompts are stored in the prompts/ folder
- For each prompt -- When it's generated, copy the prompt into content/promps and stamp it with GENERATED and time -- use the terminal to get the current time
- The prompts are meant to be single shot to achieve a task. They are not meant to be interlaced together.
- Each prompts is manually generated, do not generate prompts in the prompts/ folder
