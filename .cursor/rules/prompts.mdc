# Prompts

- All site prompts are stored in the prompts/ folder
- For each prompt -- mark at the top if it's been used or not with "GENERATED". If it has been GENERATED ignore the contents. Make sure you timestamp when it was generated
- The prompts are meant to be single shot to achieve a task. They are not meant to be interlaced together.
- Each prompts is manually generated, do not generate prompts in the prompts/ folder
